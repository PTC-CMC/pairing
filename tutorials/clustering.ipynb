This is a sparse matrix in which position [i,i] in the matrix represents molecule i and position [i,j] represents the pairing of molecule i and molecule j.  A value of 1 represents two molecules are paired, and a value of 0 represents two molecules are unpaired.\n",

    "The function to calculate this is `pairing.calc_direct`.  This function has two arguments: `trj` and `cutoff`.  `trj` is a MDTraj trajectory, and `cutoff` is the distance cutoff that determines whether or not two molecules are paired.\n",

In this system, bead 1 is paired to bead 5, bead 5 is paired to bead 3, bead 3 is paired to bead 2, and bead 4 is unpaired.  As a result, the following direct correlation matrix represents this system:\n",
